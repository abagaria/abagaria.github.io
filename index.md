I am a <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> PhD student at Brown University working with <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/" target="_blank">George Konidaris</a>. I am a part of the <a href="http://irl.cs.brown.edu/"> Intelligent Robot Lab (IRL) </a> and the Brown <a href="http://bigai.cs.brown.edu/">BigAI</a> initiative.

I study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" target="_blank">Reinforcement Learning (RL)</a> with the goal of creating general purpose robots that can learn from raw sensorimotor data. Currently, I am working on solving the skill discovery problem - how can agents automatically break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems by simply interacting with their environment? I believe that the ability to discover such procedural abstractions is a hallmark of intelligence and will allow AI agents to solve hard problems in harsh environments.

I graduated from <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a> in 2016, where I was part of the <a href="">Lab for Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics (LAIR)</a> and was advised by Professor Chris Clark. I then worked at Apple in Cupertino, CA for 2 years as part of the multitouch algorithms team under the leadership of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FingerWorks">Wayne Westerman</a>.
