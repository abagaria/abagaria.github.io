I am a <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> PhD student at Brown University working with <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/" target="_blank">George Konidaris</a>.

My research is in the field of Reinforcement Learning. More specifically, I am interested in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning which seeks to equip AI agents with the ability to break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems - simply by interacting with the environment.
