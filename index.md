I am a <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> PhD student at Brown University working with <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/" target="_blank">George Konidaris</a>. I am a part of the <a href="http://irl.cs.brown.edu/"> Intelligent Robot Lab (IRL) </a> and the Brown <a href="http://bigai.cs.brown.edu/">BigAI</a> initiative. I was an intern in David Silver's RL team at <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/">DeepMind</a>, London in Summer 2022 where I was mentored by <a href="https://schaul.site44.com/">Tom Schaul</a>.

I study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" target="_blank">Reinforcement Learning (RL)</a> with the goal of creating general purpose agents that can learn from raw sensorimotor data. Currently, I am focussed on the problems of exploration and skill discovery.

I graduated from <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a> in 2016, where I was part of the <a href="https://www.lair.hmc.edu">Lab for Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics (LAIR)</a> and was advised by Professor Chris Clark. I then worked at Apple in Cupertino, CA for 2 years as part of the Multitouch Algorithms team under the leadership of Nicole Wells and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FingerWorks">Wayne Westerman</a>. 

### __News__
* **May 2023**: Our paper on count-based exploration has been accepted for an *oral* at ICML, pre-print coming soon! 
* **Apr 2023**: Our paper on Proto-goal RL has been accepted at IJCAI 2023 -- looking forward to Macau!
* **Feb 2023**: After an amazing internship with Tom at Deepmind, we have published my internship paper to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04693v1">arxiv</a>.
* **March 2022**: I accepted an internship position at Deepmind, London for the upcoming summer under the mentorship of <a href="https://schaul.site44.com/">Tom Schaul</a>.
* **March 2022**: I will be presenting 4 papers at RLDM: 2 first author papers (Skill Graphs and Pseudocount exploration) and 2 co-author papers (Average Options and Learning Salient Events in RL). If you are going to be at RLDM, let me know --- I am always up for a chat!
* **December 2021**: Our paper *Optimistic Initialization for Exploration in Continuous Control* was accepted at AAAI! I think this paper marks the start of our journey in understanding the hard problem of exploration.
* **May 2021**: Our paper *Skill Discovery for Exploration and Planning using Deep Skill Graphs* was accepted for a **Long Talk (Top 3% of sumbissions)** at ICML 2021! This paper was hard work, but signifies my main research interests.
* **May 2021**: Our paper *Robustly Learning Composable Skills in Deep Reinforcement Learning* got accepted at IJCAI 2021! 
* **April 2021**: I successfully defended my PhD comprehensive exams! I presented progress on *Skill Discovery for Long Horizon Problems* to my committee members <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/" target="_blank">George Konidaris</a>, <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/" target="_blank">Michael Littman</a> and <a href="https://h2r.cs.brown.edu" target="_blank">Stefanie Tellex</a>.
* **Jul 2020**: Our paper *Skill Discovery for Exploration and Planning using Deep Skill Graphs* was accepted at the <a href="https://lifelongml.github.io" target="_blank">4th Lifelong Learning Workshop</a> at ICML 2020. It was great fun to present this paper virtually at the workshop!
* **Apr 2020**: I virtually presented my poster for Deep Skill Chaining at ICLR 2020. Here is the link to my recorded video <a href="https://iclr.cc/virtual_2020/poster_B1gqipNYwH.html" target="_blank"> presentation</a>.
* **Dec 2019**: Our paper *Option Discovery using Deep Skill Chaining* has been accepted for ICLR 2020! Can't wait to go to Ethiopia!
* **Dec 2019**: I presented a poster on skill discovery at the Deep Reinforcement Learning Workshop at NeurIPS in Vancover, Canada
* **Oct 2019**: I proposed my research comps on *Skill Discovery for Long Horizon Problems*. Thanks to my committee members <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/" target="_blank">George Konidaris</a>, <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/~mlittman/" target="_blank">Michael Littman</a> and <a href="https://h2r.cs.brown.edu" target="_blank">Stefanie Tellex</a> for their valuable feedback. Looking forward to making some progress on this problem and defending next semester!
