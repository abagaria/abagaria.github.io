I am a <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> PhD student at Brown University working with <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/" target="_blank">George Konidaris</a>.

I study Reinforcement Learning with the goal of creating general purpose robots that can learn by simply interacting with the environment. More specifically, my research is trying to RL equip agents with the ability to take any complex problem and break it down into simpler sub-problems. The question of how AI agents can do this automomously can be formulated as the Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) problem.
