I am a first year Ph.D. student in
<a href="http://sc.cs.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Societal Computing</a>
at Carnegie Mellon University advised by
<a href="http://zicokolter.com/" target="_blank">Zico Kolter</a>.
My research interests involve using artificial intelligence, specifically reinforcement learning, to address social challenges, with a particular interest in sustainability.
My current research focuses on safely exploring the dynamics of real-world systems in order to avoid damaging the system.
I am applying this work to improve the energy efficiency of complex systems, such as in car engines and nuclear reactors.
