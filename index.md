I am a <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> PhD student at Brown University working with <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/" target="_blank">George Konidaris</a>. I am a part of the <a href="http://irl.cs.brown.edu/"> Intelligent Robot Lab (IRL) </a> and the Brown <a href="http://bigai.cs.brown.edu/">BigAI</a> initiative. I was an intern in David Silver's RL team at <a href="https://www.deepmind.com/">DeepMind</a>, London in Summer 2022 where I was mentored by <a href="https://schaul.site44.com/">Tom Schaul</a>.

I study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" target="_blank">Reinforcement Learning (RL)</a> with the goal of creating general-purpose agents that can learn from raw sensorimotor data. Currently, I am focussed on the problems of exploration and skill discovery.

I graduated from <a href="https://www.hmc.edu/">Harvey Mudd College</a> in 2016, where I was part of the <a href="https://www.lair.hmc.edu">Lab for Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics (LAIR)</a> and was advised by Professor Chris Clark. I then worked at Apple in Cupertino, CA for 2 years as part of the Multitouch Algorithms team under the leadership of Nicole Wells and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FingerWorks">Wayne Westerman</a>.
