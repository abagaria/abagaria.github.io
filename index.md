I am a <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> PhD student at Brown University working with <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/" target="_blank">George Konidaris</a>.

I study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" target="_blank"> Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the goal of creating general purpose robots that can learn by simply interacting with the environment. More specifically, my research is trying to equip RL agents with the ability to take any complex problem and break it down into simpler sub-problems. The question of how AI agents can do this automomously from raw sensorimotor data can be formulated as the Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) problem.
