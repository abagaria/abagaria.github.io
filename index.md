I am a <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> PhD student at Brown University working with <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/people/gdk/" target="_blank">George Konidaris</a>. I am a part of the <a href="http://irl.cs.brown.edu/"> Intelligent Robot Lab (IRL) </a> and the Brown <a href="http://bigai.cs.brown.edu/">BigAI</a> initiative.

I study <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning" target="_blank">Reinforcement Learning (RL)</a> with the goal of creating general purpose robots that can learn from raw sensorimotor data. Through work in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL), I am trying to enable RL agents to better solve complex problems by first discovering useful sub-problems. I believe that the ability to autonomously discover and solve such sub-problems will allow us to create generally intelligent robots that can perform robustly in the real world.

I graduated from Harvey Mudd College in 2016, where I was part of the Lab for Autonomous and Intelligent Robotics (LAIR) and was advised by Professor Chris Clark. I then worked at Apple for 2 years as part of the multitouch algorithms team under the leadership of Wayne Westerman.
