I am a first year Ph.D. student in
<a href="https://cs.brown.edu/" target="_blank">Computer Science</a>
at Carnegie Mellon University.
I am advised by
<a href="http://zicokolter.com/" target="_blank">Zico Kolter</a>.
My research involves using artificial intelligence, specifically reinforcement learning, to address social challenges, with a particular interest in environmental sustainability.
My current research focuses on safely exploring the dynamics of real-world systems.
I am applying this work to improve the energy efficiency of complex systems, such as in car engines and fusion reactors.
I am funded by the NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.
